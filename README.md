# 2D Momentum Computation System
## Synopsis:
Solving two dimensional conservation of momentum physics problems is a long and painful process. There are many calculations that must be preformed in order to solve just one of these problem. The 2D Momentum Computation System is the solution to these issues by providing a Windows command line program, which is built using Notepad++ and the MinGW C++ compiler. All the user/physics student has to do is enter the values given by the question and the program will quickly solve the problem. Problems that can be solved using this program include two object collisions with the unknown momentum vector before or after the collision. Furthermore, these two objects can be fuse together after the collision and the question can still be solved.

## Motivation:
The purpose of this project is to apply the intricate nature of two dimensional conservation momentum questions with the concepts and skills of object oriented programming. Specifically using the Vector class that was developed in the [Vector Addition Solver](https://github.com/kgorgi/Vector-Addition-Solver) project and apply the class (without the class being modified) in a completely different scenario. 

## Installation:
To use the 2D Momentum Computation System please download and run the "2D_MCS.exe" file. Please note your anti-virus may need to be disabled in order for the program to function properly.
